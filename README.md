# Purpose
MiniAid is a Python-based tool designed to assist users in both pre-painting and post-painting processes for miniature models. It provides functionalities such as image cropping, sketch generation, segmentation, point cloud reconstruction, and mesh generation. The tool aims to streamline workflows for artists and hobbyists working with miniature painting and 3D modeling.

# Frameworks Used
MiniAid leverages the following frameworks and libraries:

* Flask: For building the web application and serving static files.
* OpenCV: For image processing and manipulation.
* Open3D: For point cloud visualization and manipulation.
* Ultralytics Yolov11: For segmentation tasks.
* VGG-T: For 3D reconstruction and alignment.
* ReportLab: For generating PDFs with color palettes.
* Pillow (PIL): For image handling and manipulation.

# How to Collaborate

# How to Set Up

Follow these steps to set up MiniAid locally:

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Pip (Python package manager)
* Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/GustavoSantiago113/MiniAid.git
cd MiniAid
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Flask application:

```
cd app
python app.py
```

5. Use as a Standalone application:

```
pyinstaller --windowed --add-data "templates;templates" --add-data "static;static" --add-data "utils;utils" --collect-data=gradio_client --collect-data=gradio app.py
```

# How to Use

## Pre-Painting
1. Navigate to the **Pre-Painting** page.
2. Upload an image to crop and generate a sketch.
3. Adjust the crop area and save the cropped image.
4. Write the part and select the respective color.
5. Generate a PDF with color palettes based on the cropped image.

![Sketch](README_images/sketch.png)

## Post-Painting
1. Navigate to the Post-Painting page.

![Post Painting](README_images/postPaint.png)

2. Upload multiple images of your miniature model.
3. Perform segmentation to isolate specific areas of the images.

![Segmentation](README_images/segmentation.png)

4. Change the Black Point of the images to make it look darker and cooler.

![Black Point](README_images/blackPoint.png)

5. Download the segmented image to share in your social media.
6. Generate a point cloud from the uploaded images.

![Reconstruction](README_images/reconstruction.png)

7. (Optional) Increase the confidence from the model to refine it, or use your mouse as brush to remove undesired points.
8. Download the point cloud for further use.
9. Or you can download the Mesh to show it later.
